__With the release of Elm 0.18 the official libraries `Navigation` and `UrlParser` have become a lot more robust and useful. They now integrate a lot of the functionality that Hop used to provide for previous versions of Elm. For example `UrlParser` now has `parseHash` and `parsePath`. Because of this I'm not convinced that Hop needs to be upgraded to Elm 0.18. I'll wait and see if this library could provide value in 0.18.__

Hop is a helper library meant to be used with:

- [__Navigation__](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/navigation) for listening to location changes in the browser and pushing changes to it.
- [__UrlParser__](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/url-parser) for constructing routes and parsing URLs.

## What Hop provides

On top of these two packages above, Hop helps with:

- Abstracting the differences between push or hash routing
- Providing helpers for working with the query string
- Encode / Decode the location path
- Encode / Decode the query string

## Getting Started

Please see this [example app](https://github.com/sporto/hop/blob/master/examples/basic/Main.elm). It explains how to wire everything in the comments.

### Hash routing

A proper url should have the query before the hash e.g. `?keyword=Ja#/users/1`,
but when using hash routing, query parameters are appended after the hash path e.g. `#/users/1?keyword=Ja`. 
This is done for aesthetics and so the router is fully controlled by the hash fragment.
